Feature: eBay sort results
  As a eBay guest user,
  I want to be able to sort my results




  # Could not get to the dropdown via actions, or sendKeys(TAB)
#Scenario: New user can sort by their result
#  Given A user is on eBay homepage
#  When the user search for "Life of Pi"
#  Then the user can see their search results for "Life of Pi"
#  When the user sort their results by: "lowest Price + P&P"
#  Then the user can see their results sorted by: "lowest Price + P&P"
